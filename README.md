# FastSpeech 2 - PyTorch Implementation

This is a PyTorch implementation of Microsoft's text-to-speech system [**FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558v1). 
This project is based on [xcmyz's implementation](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastSpeech) of FastSpeech. Feel free to use/modify the code.

There are several versions of FastSpeech 2.
This implementation is more similar to [version 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558v1), which uses F0 values as the pitch features.
On the other hand, pitch spectrograms extracted by continuous wavelet transform are used as the pitch features in the [later versions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558).

# Audio Samples
Audio samples generated by this implementation can be found [here](https://ming024.github.io/FastSpeech2/). 

# Quickstart

## Dependencies
You can install the Python dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

You have to download the [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DOhZGlTLMbbAAFZmZGDdc77kz1PloS7F?usp=sharing) and put them in ``output/ckpt/LJSpeech/``,  ``output/ckpt/AISHELL3``, or ``output/ckpt/LibriTTS/``.

For English single-speaker TTS, run
```
python synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT" --restore_step 900000 --mode single -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml
```

For Mandarin multi-speaker TTS, try
```
python synthesize.py --text "大家好" --speaker_id SPEAKER_ID --restore_step 600000 --mode single -p config/AISHELL3/preprocess.yaml -m config/AISHELL3/model.yaml -t config/AISHELL3/train.yaml
```

For English multi-speaker TTS, run
```
python synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT"  --speaker_id SPEAKER_ID --restore_step 800000 --mode single -p config/LibriTTS/preprocess.yaml -m config/LibriTTS/model.yaml -t config/LibriTTS/train.yaml
```

For my previous TTS, run
```
python synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT" --restore_step "step_number" --mode single -p config/mytts/preprocess.yaml -m config/mytts/model.yaml -t config/mytts/train.yaml
```

The generated utterances will be put in ``output/result/``.

Here is an example of synthesized mel-spectrogram of the sentence "Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition", with the English single-speaker TTS model.

## Batch Inference
Batch inference is also supported, try

```
python synthesize.py --source preprocessed_data/LJSpeech/val.txt --restore_step 900000 --mode batch -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml
```
to synthesize all utterances in ``preprocessed_data/LJSpeech/val.txt``

## Controllability
The pitch/volume/speaking rate of the synthesized utterances can be controlled by specifying the desired pitch/energy/duration ratios.
For example, one can increase the speaking rate by 20 % and decrease the volume by 20 % by

```
python synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT" --restore_step 900000 --mode single -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml --duration_control 0.8 --energy_control 0.8
```

# Training

## Datasets

The supported datasets are

- [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/): a single-speaker English dataset consists of 13100 short audio clips of a female speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books, approximately 24 hours in total.
- [AISHELL-3](http://www.aishelltech.com/aishell_3): a Mandarin TTS dataset with 218 male and female speakers, roughly 85 hours in total.
- [LibriTTS](https://research.google/tools/datasets/libri-tts/): a multi-speaker English dataset containing 585 hours of speech by 2456 speakers.

We take LJSpeech as an example hereafter.

For mytts dataset, there is wav voice datas in mytts_wav directory and transcript .xlsx file mytts_script.

## Preprocessing
 
First, run 
```
python prepare_align.py config/mytts/preprocess.yaml
```
for some preparations.

As described in the paper, [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (MFA) is used to obtain the alignments between the utterances and the phoneme sequences.
Alignments of the supported datasets are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DBRkALpPd6FL9gjHMmMEdHODmkgNIIK4?usp=sharing).
For mytts, follow (MFA) tutorial and make TextGrid files.
You have to unzip the files in ``preprocessed_data/mytts/TextGrid/``.

After that, run the preprocessing script by
```
python preprocess.py config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml
```

## Training

Train your model with
```
python train.py -p config/mytts/preprocess.yaml -m config/mytts/model.yaml -t config/mytts/train.yaml
```

The model takes less than 10k steps (less than 1 hour on my GTX1080Ti GPU) of training to generate audio samples with acceptable quality, which is much more efficient than the autoregressive models such as Tacotron2.

# TensorBoard

Use
```
tensorboard --logdir output/log/LJSpeech
```

to serve TensorBoard on your localhost.
The loss curves, synthesized mel-spectrograms, and audios are shown.

# Implementation Issues

- Following [xcmyz's implementation](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastSpeech), I use an additional Tacotron-2-styled Post-Net after the decoder, which is not used in the original FastSpeech 2.
- Gradient clipping is used in the training.
- In my experience, using phoneme-level pitch and energy prediction instead of frame-level prediction results in much better prosody, and normalizing the pitch and energy features also helps. Please refer to ``config/README.md`` for more details.

Please inform me if you find any mistakes in this repo, or any useful tips to train the FastSpeech 2 model.
